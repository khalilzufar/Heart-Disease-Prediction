- Provide preventive information for high-risk patients and health guidance for low-risk patients.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Modeling: Scikit-Learn (KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier), XGBoost
  - Preprocessing: MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder, SMOTE
  - Feature Selection: kendalltau, chi2_contingency
  - Pipeline Management: Pipeline, ColumnTransformer
