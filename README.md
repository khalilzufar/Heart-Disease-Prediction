# Heart Disease Prediction ❤️

## Overview 🌟
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of heart failure based on available medical data. The analysis includes:

- 🧑‍💻 Data Exploration
- 🧹 Data Cleaning
- 🔍 Modeling
- 📊 Evaluation

The model is accessible via a demo deployment on Hugging Face, allowing users to input their medical data and receive risk predictions, promoting early detection and prevention of heart disease.

## Objectives 🎯
- Identify individuals at high risk of heart disease using medical data.
- Provide preventive information for high-risk patients.
